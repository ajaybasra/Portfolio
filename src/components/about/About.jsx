          Apart from learning new things, I love keeping fit at the gym or shooting hoops with mates. When it comes to relaxing I enjoy binge watching anime or hitting the local cinema. I've also been reading books on investing and in particular have been wanting to become more knowledgeable about index funds üíµ .

              Spirited Away is one of my favourite movies of all time, and in my opinion, everyone should watch it at least once (it's that good!).
